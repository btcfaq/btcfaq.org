				<p>
					Below is an introduction to Bitcoin, trying to address the top questions, concerns, and fears that newcomers might have. Reading through all of the FAQs, in order, is a great way to get a feel for Bitcoin.
				</p>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#1. I've heard that Bitcoin is slow and can't be used for many transactions - is that true?</h4>
				<p>
					Yes, and no. Bitcoin, throughout its history, has been understood in different ways. 
				</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#9. Which "Bitcoin" is the right one?!</h4>
				<p>Bitcoin, the real Bitcoin, is just called "Bitcoin", and it's ticker is almost universally "BTC". The real Bitcoin is also the one that is more valueable/expensive to buy (you get what you pay for!). Unfortunately, throughout Bitcoin's history, various factions have broken off from the larger Bitcoin community and they believed that if they could steal the name "Bitcoin" for their own project, they could steal all of Bitcoin's value. Despite coordinated, long term attempts via misleading marketing and PR to steal the name and mantle of Bitcoin, the original Bitcoin (BTC) has continually maintained the largest development community, the strongest investor backing, and the widest acceptance by merchants and exchanges. Do not fall victim to one of Bitcoin's counterfeit impostors; be particularly wary of so-called "Bitcoin Cash" which is pushed on the domain bitcoin(dot)com - this is NOT Bitcoin and members of that impostor coin's community have hoodwinked many investors using misleading marketing.</p>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#10. Alright. I'm convinced there's something to it. What's next?</h4>
				<p>Bitcoin represents the cutting edge of money, economics, and distributed computing. As such, the entire community is continually learning what Bitcoin really <span class="font-italic">is</span>. Learning can take many forms, depending on your goals and personality. See if any of the below subsections fit how you're feeling now...</p>

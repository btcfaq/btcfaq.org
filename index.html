				<h4>#0 (a). What is this website?</h4>
				<p>
					By now you've probably heard about Bitcoin (BTC), but you probably don't understand it. It represents one of the best investments of the last decade and may be one of the best investments of this decade too. But, as investment wisdom tells us, one shouldn't invest in something they don't understand. This site offers content, in the form of "frequently asked questions", to kick-start your knowledge and understanding of Bitcoin, particularly as an investment vehicle. Note, however, that this is not investment advice, and you should continue to do your own research.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#0 (b). Why does this site exist and who wrote it?</h4>
				<p>
					I believe Bitcoin is already a great force for <span class="font-italic">good</span> in the world and the stronger it becomes, both technologically and economically, the more good I believe it can do. Its positive influences have included: providing an economic "escape hatch" for peoples in repressive economic environments, simplifying and making cheaper cross-border payments/remittances, allowing people all over the world to invest in something that cannot have its value stolen via politically motivated inflation, and incentivizing saving rather than spending which reduces the destructive global effects of consumerism...among others. You may also have guessed that I am a Bitcoin investor myself, which I proudly admit is true. It feels good to invest in something you believe to be <span class="font-italic">good</span> and I certainly hope to increase the value and strength of Bitcoin by educating future investors.

				<h3 class="font-weight-light">Getting Started</h3>
				<p>
					Below is an introduction to Bitcoin, trying to address the top questions, concerns, and fears that newcomers might have. Reading through all of the FAQs, in order, is a great way to get a feel for Bitcoin.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#1. What makes Bitcoin special?</h4>
				<p>Bitcoin is not controlled by <span class="font-italic">anyone</span>. No person, group, or government can change it unilaterally. Rather, an inclusive, global network of voluntary participants (including programmers, scientists, investors, business owners, and maybe, someday, <span class="font-italic">you</span>!) decides together how they want it to function. The open inclusion of so many disparate participants, with different motives and incentives, builds a natural checks-and-balances system that makes Bitcoin very resistant to the whims of any particular short-sighted sub-group (think "politicians" in most other human systems). Bitcoin, as an investment, is also very special because it is the only truly <span class="font-italic">scarce</span> digital asset. Scarcity is what gives things value and the fundamental scientific/programming breakthrough at the heart of Bitcoin represents the first (and only) ever digital scarcity - no one can counterfeit Bitcoin and there is a limited number of Bitcoin units that will ever exist.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#2. To invest in Bitcoin, do I need to understand how it works, technically?</h4>
				<p>No. Due to the deeply technical nature of Bitcoin, a thorough technical understanding of the system is quite rare - often requiring a computer science or cryptography degree. But, that doesn't mean that you can't invest in it and benefit from it. By comparison, consider how little you know about the inner workings of the US Federal Reserve system, or the World Bank, or the business details of the companies whose stock you might own. You might also consider how little you understand about how email or websites work, despite them being integral to your life. For most people, it's true to say that they understand very little about not just how money works, but also what money even is!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#3. Could its value drop to zero?</h4>
				<p>Yes, it can. The truth is, Bitcoin <span class="font-italic">is</span> a high risk asset. Accordingly, most investment advisors would recommend that a smaller portion of your money/wealth be invested in it, in accordance with your risk appetite. Generally speaking, the younger you are the more risk is often recommended. Alternatively, having a higher ratio of low risk assets (like cash and bonds) in your portfolio, can often warrant the inclusion of a small amount of high risk assets, like Bitcoin. As a conceptual proof of the potential of such a strategy, a "Bitcoiner" recently discovered an interesting data point: a portfolio holding 5% Bitcoin and 95% cash would have outperformed the stock market for each of the last 6 years.<sup><a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1136969637588021250">[1]</a></sup></p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#4. Is it <span class="font-italic">really</span> worth anything?</h4>
				<p>No. But, then again, nothing is <span class="font-italic">really</span> worth anything. Money of every type only has value because enough people believe it has value. You may hear pundits or Bitcoin critics rationalize the claimed "intrinsic value" of various monies or assets (e.g. the US dollar is backed by the full faith of the US gov, or gold has industrial uses, etc), but countless types of money throughout history have lost all of their value - e.g. seashells, beads, cattle, and even government-issued money from countless failed governments.<span class="text-danger">needs work</span></p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#5. Doesn't Bitcoin use tons of energy and harm the environment?</h4>
				<p>Yes, and no. Bitcoin's energy use is integral to its security, and the fact is, as it gains in popularity and value its energy use has grown and it will continue to grow. However, studies have shown that a large majority of the energy consumed by the network is from renewable sources <sup><a href="https://coinshares.co.uk/bitcoin-mining-cost-june-2019/">[1]</a></sup>, and many people believe it actually incentivizes the expansion of renewable energy.<sup class=""><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T0OUIW89II">[1]</a></sup> Additionally, Bitcoin is designed to make more traditional money systems obsolete, like the US Dollar. Traditional money systems consume far more energy in many different forms (mining metals and stamping coins, printing bills, driving money around in armored cars, building banks to hold money, funding governmental structures to limit counterfeiting, etc).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#6. What about the other cryptocurrencies X, Y, and Z?</h4>
				<p>Bitcoin is special because it represents a fundamental breakthrough - in particular, an old computer science problem called the Byzantine Generals Problem. By solving this problem in a new way, it offers a completely new concept of money. All other cryptocurrencies are descendants of the fundamental breakthrough represented by Bitcoin. By being the first, Bitcoin has attracted most of the best computer scientists, programmers, cryptographers, and principled users. It may be exciting to imagine that X, Y, or Z is the "next Bitcoin" and will guarantee that you become extremely rich, but there have been many attempts to usurp or overshadow Bitcoin over its 10+ year history, and they have all failed. Bitcoin continues to tower above all of its children and continues to evolve and improve itself - sometimes even by copying new ideas from other projects (that's one of the great powers of open-source software, which Bitcoin is). If Bitcoin itself is a high-risk investment, all other cryptocurrencies should be considered extreme-risk assets.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h1 class="lead">#7. Didn't Bitcoin already die?</h1>
				<p>No. Bitcoin, by virtue of being technical in nature and very different than the mainstream, conventional wisdom in economics and investment circles, is often used as a punching bag in mainstream media outlets. It's common human behavior to poke fun at things we don't understand or that cause us to question our beliefs, both of which are very true about Bitcoin, for most people. Despite literally hundreds of claims over the last decade by newspapers, websites, economists, pundits, and even high profile, celebrity investors, Bitcoin is an amazingly reliable and robust system that has been running nonstop for 10+ years and has never been hacked (Note: Bitcoin "itself" has never been hacked, but individual Bitcoin users/investors and Bitcoin companies who have managed their funds poorly have been hacked).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#8. Isn't it too late? It's so expensive - I can't even afford to buy 1 BTC!</h4>
				<p>No, it's not too late. And it's no problem that you can't buy a whole Bitcoin because Bitcoin is designed to be bought in small amounts. In fact, because of Bitcoin's design, which limits the system to only ever producing 21 million Bitcoins, it's actually impossible for every millionaire in the world today to own a full Bitcoin since there are more than 21 million global millionaires. So, buying Bitcoin in smaller amounts is not only normal and expected, it is necessary. It can be a little confusing to purchase 0.001 of something, but rest assured you would not be alone in doing so. Bitcoin is currently divisible into 100,000,000 units (sometimes referred to as "satoshis", in homage to Bitcoin's unknown creator), just as dollars are divisible into 100 units (called "cents"). It's also possible for Bitcoin, in the future, to be divided into even smaller units, if necessary.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#9. Which "Bitcoin" is the right one?!</h4>
				<p>Bitcoin, the real Bitcoin, is just called "Bitcoin", and it's ticker is almost universally "BTC". The real Bitcoin is also the one that is more valueable/expensive to buy (you get what you pay for!). Unfortunately, throughout Bitcoin's history, various factions have broken off from the larger Bitcoin community and they believed that if they could steal the name "Bitcoin" for their own project, they could steal all of Bitcoin's value. Despite coordinated, long term attempts via misleading marketing and PR to steal the name and mantle of Bitcoin, the original Bitcoin (BTC) has continually maintained the largest development community, the strongest investor backing, and the widest acceptance by merchants and exchanges. Do not fall victim to one of Bitcoin's counterfeit impostors; be particularly wary of so-called "Bitcoin Cash" which is pushed on the domain bitcoin(dot)com - this is NOT Bitcoin and members of that impostor coin's community have hoodwinked many investors using misleading marketing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#10. Alright. I'm convinced there's something to it. What's next?</h4>
				<p>Bitcoin represents the cutting edge of money, economics, and distributed computing. As such, the entire community is continually learning what Bitcoin really <span class="font-italic">is</span>. Learning can take many forms, depending on your goals and personality. See if any of the below subsections fit how you're feeling now...</p>

				<h4>What is this website?</h4>
				<p>
					By now you've probably heard about Bitcoin (BTC), but you may not understand it. Bitcoin has been one of the best investments of the last decade and may be one of the best investments of the coming decade too. But, as investment wisdom tells us, one shouldn't invest in something they don't understand. This site offers content, in the form of "frequently asked questions", to kick-start your knowledge and understanding of Bitcoin, particularly as an investment. Note, however, that this is not investment advice, and you should continue to do your own research.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>Why does this site exist and who wrote it?</h4>
				<p>
					I believe that Bitcoin is already a powerful force for <span class="font-italic">good</span> in the world and the stronger it becomes, both technologically and economically, the more good I believe it can do. Its positive influences have included: providing an economic "escape hatch" for people in repressive or unstable economic environments, simplifying and reducing the cost of cross-border payments/remittances, allowing people all over the world to invest in something that cannot have its value reduced via politically motivated inflation, and incentivizing saving rather than spending which reduces the destructive global effects of consumerism...among others. I am a proud Bitcoin investor myself and hope to increase the value and strength of Bitcoin by educating more people about it. My educational background is in computer science and programming, and politically, like many other Bitcoin enthusiasts, I have a strong focus on individual liberties and freedoms. Beyond that background information, I choose to remain anonymous. I've been hesitant in the past to outright recommend Bitcoin to anyone for fear that its failure could damage personal relationships. However, its strength and stability have improved to the point that I wanted to try my hand at making an explicit case for why and how Bitcoin is a worthwhile investment. This exercise was initially undertaken to share with family and friends, though I hope it will be shared more widely over time. This site, which is a distillation of years of learning and involvement in various Bitcoin communities, is my attempt to make that case.

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>What can I expect as I read through this website?</h4>
				<p>
					All of the below content comes from a position of informed humility. A common approach by many "Bitcoiners", which I share, is to take a philosophical perspective about the issues involved. Although "money" is a profoundly commonplace object in all of our lives, Bitcoin and its underlying concepts beg one to look more closely at the commonplace. Combine this with an "engineer's" mindset which encourages a conservative approach to the trade-offs inherent in any system, and you can get to a rather abstract and sometimes even wishy-washy sounding place. Sadly, a reasoned, conservative, careful discussion that tries to avoid over-promising is often less convincing and more challenging than the clear, simple, straightforward marketing material that is on offer from anyone looking to scam others. The content below is sometimes challenging, dense, abstract, and philosophical. It represents my current best efforts (with the help of some great editor-friends!) to communicate complex and subtle material as clearly as possible...in some cases my best effort may not be up to the challenge of conveying these ideas sufficiently. If any particular point I make leaves you unconvinced, I simply recommend that you continue your own research using the links at the bottom.

				<h3 class="font-weight-light">Getting Started</h3>
				<p>
					Below is an introduction to Bitcoin, trying to address the top questions, concerns, and fears that newcomers might have. Reading through all of the FAQs, in order, will hopefully provide a solid introduction to Bitcoin.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#1. What makes Bitcoin special?</h4>
				<p>
					Scarcity. It gives things value. Bitcoin is VERY scarce - there will only ever be 21 million that exist. Having 1 BTC is roughly equivalent to having 20 lbs of gold (as a ratio of all of the gold).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#2. To invest in Bitcoin, do I need to understand how it works, technically?</h4>
				<p>
					No. You just need to understand enough to keep yourself safe. That can be a difficult task on its own, but start learning today and you can get there.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#3. Why is Bitcoin valuable?</h4>
				<p>
					Because other people value it; because it does what it's designed to 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#4. But seriously...Is it <span class="font-italic">really</span> worth anything?</h4>
				<p>
					No. Nothing is <span class="font-italic">really</span> worth anything.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#5. Could its value drop to zero?</h4>
				<p>
					Yes. And it probably will, but not for 1,000 years or more, when the next major revolution in money occurs.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#6. Doesn't Bitcoin use tons of energy and harm the environment?</h4>
				<p>
					Yes, it uses a lot of energy. It buys that energy on a global free market, because people who believe in Bitcoin are willing to pay for the energy. People are willing to pay a lot more energy for much stupider things.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#7. I've heard about some other cryptocurrencies...What about those?</h4>
				<p>
					The safest approach to all competitors: assume they are scams until proven otherwise.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#8. Didn't Bitcoin already die?</h4>
				<p>
					No. For over 10 years it has done everything it is designed to do, just as it was designed to do it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#9. Isn't it too late? It's so expensive - I can't even afford to buy 1 BTC!</h4>
				<p>
					No. Bitcoin is meant to be bought in small increments. If Bitcoin fulfills its promise, those small increments will appreciate a lot.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#10. Which "Bitcoin" is the right one?!</h4>
				<p>
					Bitcoin. BTC. Stay away from "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH) and "Bitcoin SV" (BSV) - they are scams.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h4>#11. Alright. I'm convinced there's something to it. What's next?</h4>
				<p>
					Bitcoin represents the cutting edge of money, economics, and distributed computing. As such, the entire community is continually learning what Bitcoin really <span class="font-italic">is</span>. Learning can take many forms, depending on your goals and personality. See if any of the below subsections fit how you're feeling now...
